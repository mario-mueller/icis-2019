## Abstract

Open source software is increasingly becoming platform-based, thereby evolving and depending on an ecosystem of third-party developers and their contributions in the form of modules. Thus, platform-based open source software ecosystems (POSSE) are structured based on social networks formed by the relationships between third-party developers as well as technical networks formed by dependencies between the modules extending the platform core. Despite the socio-technical nature, little is known about the interplay of the social and the technical networks, and its influence on the evolution of POSSE. In this short paper, we present our planned study to uncover the socio-technical dynamics of POSSE. By uncovering these dynamics and their effect on the evolution of POSSE, we aim to contribute to research on digital platforms and ecosystems through explaining their success and growth.
