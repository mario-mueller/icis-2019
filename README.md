## Abstract

Open source software is increasingly becoming platform-based, thereby evolving
and depending on an ecosystem of third-party developers and their contributions
in the form of software modules. Thus, platform-based open source software
ecosystems (POSSE) are structured based on social networks formed by the
relationships between third-party developers as well as technical networks
formed by dependencies between the software modules extending the core platform.
Despite the socio-technical nature of POSSE, little is known about the interplay
and influencing factors between those two layers. In this short paper, we
present our planned study to uncover the underlying technical and social
networks of POSSE. By uncovering the locations of those communities, which we
refer to as digital habits, we aim to contribute to research on digital
platforms and ecosystems through explaining the success and growth of POSSE.
