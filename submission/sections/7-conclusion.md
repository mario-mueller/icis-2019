# Conclusion

Coming back to the research question posted at the beginning of this paper, we
target the interactions of social and technical networks in platform-based open
source ecosystems as our main objective. We plan on investigating these
interaction with the help of the study of three popular ecosystems. In this
paper, we argued why the social and technical networks might interact and
described our plan on how to gather and analyse data to test our hypothesis.
