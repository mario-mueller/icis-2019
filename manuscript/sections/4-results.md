# Expected Results

Answering our research question as stated above, we expect social networks,
derived from the collaboration networks of cores and modules, to have an effect
on technical networks, derived from the dependencies of modules within
ecosystems. In detail, we expect to see that if collaboration networks are of
less modularity, dependency networks are as well. We expect this to occur, as
developers bring their own technical experience and knowledge into the projects
they are working on – including modules they have used before. This means, that
if developers collaborate on different modules together, they might use the same
dependencies across multiple modules.

Regarding the interrelation of structure and technical dependencies, we see,
apriori, no indication for the structure (i.e., collaborators) to follow the
technical dependencies – we would, as done above, argue for an inverse effect
(i.e., the technical dependencies to follow the collaborators). In our specific
context, we imagine only marginal cases in which the social network (i.e.,
collaborators) changes due to changes in the technical network (i.e.,
dependencies) – for instance, only due to a help request from the collaborators
of the including module towards collaborators of the dependency).

Further, we expect number of modules to correlate with download numbers, as a
higher number of available modules might increase the value of an ecosystem for
developers, as more modules might increase reuse and the chance to find a
suitable module for a problem at hand.

However, due to the explorative nature of this study, we remain open to
different results and different explanations [cf. @Lindberg2019].
