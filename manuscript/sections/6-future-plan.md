# Further Approach

Until the International Conference on Information Systems in December 2019, we
plan to accomplish multiple steps towards our final goal. First, we plan to have
completed our data collection (i.e., have collected all data from GitHub and npm
for all three ecosystems). This step includes cross referencing data across
GitHub and npm (e.g., releases from npm and commits included in this commit from
GitHub). As the data crawler has already been written, we expect this step to be
completed around July 2019. Second, we plan to create an internal research memo
on initial observations from the collected data. This step is important to have
a clearer understanding of the structure of the data and to prepare for detailed
quantitative analysis. We expect this step to be completed by October 2019.
Third, we plan on conducting a detailed quantitative analysis before December
2019, which contents have been laid out in the previous section. Thus, we aim to
present preliminary results of the network analysis and provide first
explanations for the influence of socio-technical dynamics on POSSEâ€™s evolution.
