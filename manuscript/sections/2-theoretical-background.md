# Theoretical Background

## Platform-based Open Source Software Ecosystems

Popular open source software (OSS), such as the Linux kernel or Node, are
platform-based, which means that they evolve around a digital platform that is
the “extensible codebase of a software-based system that provides core
functionality shared by the modules that interoperate with it and the interfaces
through which they interoperate” (Tiwana et al. 2010, p. 675). When the platform
orchestrator opens the digital platform for external developers, it transitions
to a software ecosystem (Bosch 2009, Messerschmitt and Szyperski 2003). In
software ecosystems, third-party developers contribute their time, knowledge,
and skill to increase the value of the ecosystem by participating in it through
the contribution of modules (Roberts et al. 2006), which are “add-on software
subsystem that connect to the platform to add functionality to the platform“
(Tiwana et al. 2010, p. 676). In this scenario, the platform functions as a hub
with the complementary modules as spokes connected through application
programming interfaces (APIs) or other technical standards (Jacobides et al.
2018). Accordingly, we define platform-based open source software ecosystems
(POSSE) as “a collection of digital artifacts [i.e., modules] that co-evolve
through mutual interference, and the social actors related to these artifacts
that are linked by a common interest” (Eck and Uebernickel 2016).

By enabling contributions by external actors, digital ecosystems are seen as a
growing source of innovation where capabilities shift to the outside of the
organization (Parker et al. 2017; Yoo 2013; Yoo et al. 2010). The modular
architecture allows for the coordination of heterogeneous third-party developers
that contribute interdependent modules through an ecosystem (Jacobides et al.
2018), removing third-party developers from the underlying code and enabling
contributions without full information about the functionality of the software
behind the interface. This opens up POSSE for contributions from a wide range of
developers and therefore raises the importance of understanding the
interdependencies of social and technical layers involved.

## Social and Technical Interdependencies in Open Source Projects

OSS projects rely heavily on the communities surrounding these projects –
without the contributions of time and effort of highly motivated developers, OSS
projects cannot exist (Roberts et al. 2006). In general, the success of the open
source model has led to an increase in OSS projects and new ideas on how
innovation should be managed (Singh et al. 2011). OSS projects do not always
produce software targeted at end users, but at developers and this software is
“designed to be reused and to provide functionality to other software projects”
(Haefliger et al. 2008, p. 180). Boland et al. (2007) make the point that
technology (e.g., software) per se does not herald innovation in complex
networks. Rather, diverse groups of actors with access to the technology are
those putting their capabilities to innovative uses. In the context of OSS,
voluntary software developers form project teams that emerge based on the
developers’ social networks (Hahn et al. 2008). The success of OSS projects
therefore is not only related to technical characteristics, but also to “the
project production process and the broader social environment in which
developers work” (Singh et al. 2011, p. 814). OSS projects can therefore be seen
as socio-technical systems.

As a special type of OSS, POSSE are archetypical socio-technical systems as well
and contain both technical and social aspects. From a technical perspective, the
digital ecosystem of a platform consists of the platform itself and
complementary applications build by third-party developers (Cusumano and Gawer
2002; Tiwana 2013). From a social perspective, the platform, its orchestrator,
and all the complementary software modules and their creators form the
platform’s ecosystem (Jacobides et al. 2018). Hence, POSSE do not only consist
of the platform core, its interfaces, and related modules, but also include
those third-party developers that contribute to the software ecosystem and
thereby generate additional value for the platform and its users through
increasing usage of the platform and its complementary software (Gawer and
Cusumano 2008).

Originating in biology, the term of a habitat is closely linked to ecosystems
and has been defined as the area in which a community (in this case a group of
individuals from various species) lives. We adopt this term to define the areas
of the POSSE that are made up from technical and social relationships between
the individual third-party developers and the respective modules. Thereby, we
aim to uncover communities, their habitats, and their effect on the underlying
structure and growth of POSSE.

To sum up, POSSE are the intersection of effects relating to digital platforms,
ecosystems, and OSS. This intersection, combined with the effects emerging from
the intertwined relationship of social and technical aspects, are uncharted
territory. Due to the popularity and success of OSS—and especially POSSE—this
combination of forces is a worthwhile area for research.
