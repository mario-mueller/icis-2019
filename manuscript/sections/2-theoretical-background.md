# Theoretical Background

## Platform-based Open Source Software Ecosystems

Popular OSS, such as the Linux kernel or Node, are platform-based, which means
that they evolve around a _digital platform_ that is the "extensible codebase of
a software-based system that provides core functionality shared by the modules
that interoperate with it and the interfaces through which they interoperate"
[@Tiwana2010b, 675]. When the platform orchestrator opens the digital platform
for external developers, it transitions to a _software ecosystem_ [@Bosch2009;
@Messerschmitt2003]. In software ecosystems, third-party developers contribute
their time, knowledge, and skill to increase the value of the ecosystem by
participating in it through the contribution of modules [@Roberts2006], which
are "add-on software subsystem that connect to the platform to add functionality
to the platform" [@Tiwana2010b, 676]. In this scenario, the platform functions
as a hub with the complementary modules as spokes connected through application
programming interfaces (APIs) or other technical standards [@Jacobides2018].
Accordingly, we define _platform-based open source software ecosystems_ (POSSE)
as "a collection of digital artifacts \[i.e., modules\] that co-evolve through
mutual interference, and the social actors related to these artifacts that are
linked by a common interest" [@Eck2016, 2].

By enabling contributions by external actors, digital ecosystems are seen as a
growing source of innovation where capabilities shift to the outside of the
organization [@Parker2017; @Yoo2013; @Yoo2010a]. The modular architecture allows
for the coordination of heterogeneous third-party developers that contribute
interdependent modules through an ecosystem [@Jacobides2018] in which
interoperability with the platform core is ensured through the usage of the
platform's interfaces [@Tiwana2015]. This opens up POSSE for contributions from
a wide range of developers and therefore raises the importance of understanding
the interdependencies of social and technical layers involved.

## Social and Technical Interdependencies in Open Source Projects

OSS projects rely heavily on the communities surrounding these projects --
without the contributions of time and effort of highly motivated developers, OSS
projects cannot exist [@Roberts2006]. In general, the success of the open source
model has led to an increase in OSS projects and new ideas on how innovation
should be managed [@Singh2011]. OSS projects do not always produce software
targeted at end users, but at developers and this software is "designed to be
reused and to provide functionality to other software projects" [@Haefliger2008,
180]. @Boland2007 make the point that technology (e.g., software) per se does
not herald innovation in complex networks. Rather, diverse groups of actors with
access to the technology are those putting their capabilities to innovative
uses. In the context of OSS, voluntary software developers form project teams
that emerge based on the developers' social networks [@Hahn2008]. The success of
OSS projects therefore is not only related to technical characteristics, but
also to "the project production process and the broader social environment in
which developers work" [@Singh2011, 814]. OSS projects can therefore be seen as
socio-technical systems.

As a special type of OSS, POSSE are archetypical socio-technical systems as well
and contain both technical and social aspects. From a technical perspective, the
digital ecosystem of a platform consists of the platform itself and
complementary applications build by third-party developers [@Cusumano2002;
@Tiwana2013]. From a social perspective, the platform, its orchestrator, and all
the complementary modules and their creators form the platform's ecosystem
[@Jacobides2018]. Hence, POSSE do not only consist of the platform core, its
interfaces, and related modules, but also include those third-party developers
that contribute to the software ecosystem and thereby generate additional value
for the platform and its users through increasing usage of the platform and its
complementary software [@Gawer2008].

Originating in biology, the term of a habitat is closely linked to ecosystems
and has been defined as the area in which a community (in this case a group of
individuals from various species) lives. We adopt this term to define the areas
of the POSSE that are made up from technical and social relationships between
the individual third-party developers and the respective modules. Thereby, we
aim to uncover communities, their habitats, and their effect on the underlying
structure and growth of POSSE. Figure 1 shows the components of POSSE and the
connection between the social and technical layer.

To sum up, POSSE are the intersection of effects relating to digital platforms,
ecosystems, and OSS. This intersection, combined with the effects emerging from
the intertwined relationship of social and technical aspects, are uncharted
territory. Due to the popularity and success of OSS---and especially
POSSE---this combination of forces is a worthwhile area for research.
